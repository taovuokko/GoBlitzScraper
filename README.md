## Introduction

My first version of a web scraping tool developed in Go. This project is
primarily for personal learning and exercise in web scraping techniques and Go
programming.

## Objective

- To gain a deeper understanding of web data handling and practical application
  of Go in a real-world project.


## Development Checklist

- [x] Very Basic functionality for single-page scraping
- [ ] Extend to multi-page scraping
- [ ] Develop a modular and general-purpose tool
- [ ] Implement a Text-based User Interface (TUI)

## Future Plans

The goal is to evolve this project into a more comprehensive and modular TUI program, capable of handling various web scraping tasks efficiently.
